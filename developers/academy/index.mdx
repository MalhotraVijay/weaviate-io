## Units
-----

:::info
A **unit** covers a single topic, for example to teach a particular concept, skill, or a mix of both. A unit might:

- Explain a concept, such as what vector search is, and how vector databases work.
- Teach a skill such as how to use queries, import data or select a vectorizer.

Units will be found within the context of a course, and we will also have additional 'standalone' units.
